================================
A quick howto for certain topics
================================

Building:
=========

To create the pebble war, run
mvn package

This will run all unit tests as well. To just run the unit tests, run
mvn test

Editing the website:
====================

The website is stored in src/site.  Most of the website is written in APT a lightweight wiki style markup language.
Documentation on APT can be found at http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html. Some files are written in
XHTML, where APT has not been sufficient.  Static resources can be found in the src/site/resources directory.  The
src/site.xml is the site descriptor, containing menus and the like, and the src/pebble-site.vm is the template that's
run to generate all the decorations, menus etc for the pages.  Do not edit this template unless you really know what you
are doing.

Use "mvn site:run" when editing the website.  This will start an embedded Jetty server that will render pages as they are
requested, so is very convenient.  To build the website, "mvn site", and to deploy the website use "mvn site-deploy".
Before deploying the website you need to have a few things set up, see below.

Deploying to SourceForge:
=========================

In order to deploy to sourceforge, a few things need to be set up.  Firstly, your ~/.m2/settings.xml needs to have the
sourceforge site set up, and also the username and password put in separate variables.  The reason your
username/password is needed twice is that the maven site deploy plugin will happily deploy the maven site to sourceforge
the way we want it, but the maven deploy plugin when we point it at sourceforge FRS tries to turn FRS into a maven
repository, which we don't want, consequently we upload artifacts using the maven ant plugin, which requires that we
pass usernames/passwords to it in properties.  Here is what should be in your settings.xml at a minimum:

<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>pebble.sf.net</id>
            <username>YOURUSERNAME,pebble</username>
            <password>YOURPASSWORD</password>
            <directoryPermissions>775</directoryPermissions>
            <filePermissions>664</filePermissions>
        </server>
    </servers>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>pebble</id>
            <activation>
                <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
            </activation>
            <properties>
                <pebble.sf.net.username>YOURUSERANME,pebble</pebble.sf.net.username>
                <pebble.sf.net.password>YOURPASSWORD</pebble.sf.net.password>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
</settings>

In addition to this, *everytime* before doing a deploy to sourceforge, you need to create a shell at sourceforge.  This
has to be done everytime because the way sourceforge shells work is you create it, and it is automatically destroyed
after 4 hours.  To do this, run:

ssh -t YOURUSERNAME,pebble@shell.sourceforge.net create

Releasing Pebble
================

To release pebble, simply run:

mvn release:prepare release:perform

This will prompt you for the release version number, the tag name, and the next development version (eg, if I release
2.5 the next development version might be 2.6-SNAPSHOT).  It will then update the version in the pom.xml, and do a dry
run of the build (running mvn clean verify).  If that's successful, it will commit to SVN, tag the repository, update
the version to the development snapshot, and commit again.  It will then check out pebble from the tag in a working
directory, and do a full build, including the website, and deploy them both to sourceforge.
