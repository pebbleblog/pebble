      Although Pebble has a comprehensive web-based administration interface, it also supports the Blogger API for managing your blog content via compatible blogging clients. Examples here include NetNewsWire, ecto, w.bloggar and the J2ME <a href="../moblog/index.html">Pebble moblog client</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <img src="./images/blogger-api-1.png" align="right" hspace="8" />To enable this, click the <b>Blog properties</b> link after logging in. Towards the bottom of this page is a section entitled <b>Blogger and MetaWeblog APIs</b> where you can enable or disable the feature.
      </p>

      <p>
      To ensure that only authorized people post to your blog, you need to define a username and password. When using a blogging client, you will be asked for this username and password to authenticate yourself. In addition to this, you will need to specify the XML-RPC API, XML-RPC URL for your blog and a blog ID. These values are displayed in the window, underneath the authentication information.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h5>Titles and Categories</h5>
      Because the Blogger API is fairly simplistic, by default it has no support for things like blog entry titles and categories. However, with Pebble, it possible to specify these attributes for your blog entry. To do this, simply prepend your blog entry body with <code>&lt;title&gt;Your title here&lt;/title&gt;</code> and/or <code>&lt;category&gt;categoryId1,categoryId2&lt;/category&gt;</code>.
