      <p>
      Although Pebble has a comprehensive web-based administration interface, it also supports the MetaWeblog API for managing your blog content via compatible blogging clients. Examples here include NetNewsWire, ecto, w.bloggar and the J2ME <a href="../moblog/index.html">Pebble moblog client</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <img src="./images/metaweblog-api-1.png" align="right" hspace="8" />To enable this, click the <b>Blog properties</b> link after logging in. Towards the bottom of this page is a section entitled <b>Blogger and MetaWeblog APIs</b> where you can enable or disable the feature.
      </p>

      <p>
      To ensure that only authorized people post to your blog, you need to define a username and password. When using a blogging client, you will be asked for this username and password to authenticate yourself. In addition to this, you will need to specify the XML-RPC API, XML-RPC URL for your blog and a blog ID. These values are displayed in the window, underneath the authentication information.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h5>Uploading images and files</h5>
      With the MetaWeblog API you can upload images and other files to your blog. By default, any files you upload will be stored underneath the <code>blog.dir/images</code> directory which is assessible through Pebble via the <b>Images</b> link that appears after logging in.
      To explicitly specify where the file should be uploaded to, prefix the filename with <code>images/</code> or <code>files/</code> to store the file under the <code>blog.dir/images</code> or <code>blog.dir/files</code> respectively. If required, you can also specify a directory structure in the filename such as <code>images/2004/someimage.jpg</code>.
