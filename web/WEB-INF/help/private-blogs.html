      Although weblogs are generally a public way of sharing ideas and opinions, there may be times when you want to set up a private blog - perhaps a dedicated project blog or a blog that only family members can access. Since Pebble uses the standard Java Servlet security model, setting up a private blog is straightforward.

      <p>
      The <code>web.xml</code> file inside the Pebble WAR file contains a block of text like the following that can serve as a starting point.

          this is an example of how to setup a private blog
          (1) set the url-pattern to include the blog(s) you wish to make private
          (2) set the role-name (this can be anything)
          (3) configure users in your security realm (app server specific)
          (4) add the role to the auth-constraint section in the above security constraint
        --&gt;
        &lt;security-constraint&gt;
          &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
            &lt;web-resource-name&gt;Private Blog Realm&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/privateblog/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
            &lt;http-method&gt;GET&lt;/http-method&gt;
            &lt;http-method&gt;HEAD&lt;/http-method&gt;
            &lt;http-method&gt;POST&lt;/http-method&gt;
          &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
          &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
            &lt;role-name&gt;privateblog-user&lt;/role-name&gt;
          &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
        &lt;/security-constraint&gt;</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
      To define a private blog, you need to modify the <code>url-pattern</code> element. Examples for the value of this element are <code>/*</code> to secure an entire blog in single user mode or all blogs in multi-user mode, or <code>/someblog/*</code> to secure a single blog in multi-user mode. Next, set the value of the <code>role-name</code> element to specify which group of users can access the secured resource and this can be any value. Finally you'll need to define the appropriate users in your application/web server security realm. For Tomcat, users are added to the <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml</code> file. After restarting the server, any attempt to access the URL specified in the <code>url-pattern</code> element will require authentication. If you need to have more than one secure blog, copy this <code>security-constraint</code> section and edit the <code>url-pattern</code> and <code>role-name</code> as appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
      <blockquote><b>Note</b> : In multi-user mode, all blogs will automatically show up on the multi-user front page and their content will appear in the combined news feeds. To stop this from occurring you can mark your blog to be private in the <a href="configuration.html">blog properties</a>.</blockquote>
