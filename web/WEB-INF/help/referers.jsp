      Pebble keeps track of your referers - those websites that have links to your blog. Typically, when a user clicks on a link to your blog from another website, the URL of that website is included in the underlying HTTP request and Pebble keeps a note of it.
      To see your referers for the current day, click <a href="viewReferers.secureaction">Referers</a>.

    <h3>Referer Filters</h3>
    <p>
      Referers can be very useful indicators, but it is possible for them to be spoofed as any arbitrary URL. The reasons for doing this include companies trying to get free advertising by getting their URLs onto your website or trying to get better rankings in the search engines. After all, the more pages that reference their websites, the higher up the ranks their websites will appear in places like Google.
      While this is generally harmless, it can be annoying and can skew your statistics. Also, the links are often of an adult nature or simply unrelated to your blog. For this reason, Pebble allows you to filter specific referers from showing in your list. The <a href="viewRefererFilters.secureaction">Referers filters</a> page lets
      you add regular expressions that act as filters. For example, to stop all Google searches from showing up in your referer list would require a filter of <code>.*google.*</code>.
