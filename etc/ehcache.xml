        Specifies a CacheManagerEventListenerFactory  which will be used to create a CacheManagerPeerProvider, which

        The attributes of CacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Sets the fully qualified class name to be registered as the CacheManager event listener.

    The events include:
    - adding a Cache
    - removing a Cache

    Callbacks to listener methods are synchronous and unsynchronized. It is the responsibility of the implementer
    to safely handle the potential performance and thread safety issues depending on what their listener is doing.

    If no class is specified, no listener is created. There is no default.

        (Enable for distributed operation)

        Specifies a CacheManagerPeerProviderFactory which will be used to create a CacheManagerPeerProvider, which
        discovers other CacheManagers in the cluster.

         The attributes of cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system with two means of discovery of CacheManager peers
        participating in the cluster:
         - automatic, using a multicast group. This one automatically discovers peers and detects changes such as
           peers entering and leaving the group
         - manual, using manual rmiURL configuration. A hardcoded list of peers is provided at configuration time.

        Configuring Automatic Discovery:
        Automatic discovery is configured as per the following example:
        <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                              properties="peerDiscovery=automatic, multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1, multicastGroupPort=4446"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "automatic"
        - multicastGroupAddress (mandatory) - specify a valid multicast group address
        - multicastGroupPort (mandatory) - specify a dedicated port for the multicast hearbeat traffic

        Configuring Manual Discovery:
        Manual discovery is configured as per the following example:
        <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                              properties="peerDiscovery=manual,
                              rmiUrls=//server1:40000/sampleCache1|//server2:40000/sampleCache1|//server1:40000/sampleCache2|//server2:40000/sampleCache2"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "manual"
        - rmiUrls (mandatory) - specify a pipe separated list of rmiUrls, in the form //hostname:port

        The hostname is the hostname of the remote CacheManager peer. The port is the listening port of the RMICacheManagerPeerListener
        of the remote CacheManager peer.

    <!--
        An alternate CacheManagerPeerProviderFactory can be used for JNDI discovery of other CacheManagers in the cluster.
        Only manual discovery is supported.

        Correspondingly for cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory specify class net.sf.ehcache.distribution.JNDIRMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactoryory.

        Configuring JNDI Manual Discovery:
        Manual JNDI discovery is configured as per the following example:
        <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.JNDIManualRMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactoryerFactory"
                              properties="peerDiscovery=manual, stashContexts=true, stashRemoteCachePeers=true, 
                              jndiUrls=t3//server1:40000/sampleCache1|t3//server2:40000/sampleCache1|t3//server1:40000/sampleCache2|t3//server2:40000/sampleCache2"/>

        Valid properties are:
        - peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "manual"
        - stashContexts (optional) - specify "true" or "false".  Defaults to true.  java.naming.Context objects are stashed for performance.
        - stashRemoteCachePeers (optional) - specify "true" or "false".  Defaults to true.  CachePeer objects are stashed for performance.
        - jndiUrls (mandatory) - specify a pipe separated list of jndiUrls, in the form protocol//hostname:port

        Specifies a CacheManagerPeerListenerFactory which will be used to create a CacheManagerPeerListener, which
        listens for messages from cache replicators participating in the cluster.

         The attributes of cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory are:
        - class - a fully qualified factory class name
        - properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

        Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system. The listener component is RMICacheManagerPeerListener
        which is configured using RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory. It is configured as per the following example:

        Valid properties are:
        - hostName (optional) - the hostName of the host the listener is running on. Specify where the host is multihomed
        and you want to control the interface over which cluster messages are received.
        - port (mandatory) - the port the listener listens on.
        - socketTimeoutMillis (optional) - the number of seconds client sockets will wait when sending messages to this listener

        Cache elements can also contain sub elements which take the same format of a factory class and properties. Defined
        sub-elements are:

        * cacheEventListenerFactory - Enables registration of listeners for cache events, such as put, remove, update, expire

        * bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a BootstrapCacheLoader, which is called by a cache on initialisation to
        prepopulate itself.


        Each cache that will be distributed needs to set a cache event listener which then replicates messages to the
        other CacheManager peers. For the built-in RMI implementation this is done by adding a cacheEventListenerFactory
        element of type RMICacheReplicatorFactory to each distributed cache's configuration as per the following example:

        <cacheEventListenerFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheReplicatorFactory"
             properties="replicateAsynchronously=true,
             replicatePuts=true,
             replicateUpdates=true,
             replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true,
             replicateRemovals=true "/>

        The RMICacheReplicatorFactory recognises the following properties:

        * replicatePuts=true | false - whether new elements placed in a cache are
          replicated to others. Defaults to true.

        * replicateUpdates=true | false - whether new elements which override an
          element already existing with the same key are replicated. Defaults to true.

        * replicateRemovals=true - whether element removals are replicated. Defaults to true.

        * replicateAsynchronously=true | false - whether replications are
          asynchronous (true) or synchronous (false). Defaults to true.

        * replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true | false - whether the new elements are
          copied to other caches (true), or whether a remove message is sent. Defaults to true.


        The RMI-based BootstrapCacheLoader is configured as per the following example:

        <bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory"
            properties="bootstrapAsynchronously=true, maximumChunkSizeBytes=5000000"/>

        The RMIBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory recognises the following optional properties:

        * bootstrapAsynchronously=true | false - whether the bootstrap happens in the background after the cache has started.
          If false, bootstrap must complete before the cache is made available. The default value is true.

        * maximumChunkSizeBytes=<integer> - Caches can potentially be very large, larger than the memory limits of the VM.
          Enables the cache bootstrap to be fetched in chunks. The default value is 5000000 (5MB).
